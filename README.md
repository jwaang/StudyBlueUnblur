# StudyBlueUnblur
Unblurs the flash cards on studyblue.com and increases box size   

This was my first time creating a chrome extension, so I decided to practice it on studyblue.com   
Studyblue.com is a great resource for getting quick answers, however their website blurs out the answer. This can easily be fixed by inspecting element and turning off the css which is exactly what my extension does. In addition, it also increases the box size and decreases the font size so more information can be displayed.

# StudyBlueUnblur
Unblurs the flash cards on studyblue.com and increases box size   

# Problem
This was my first time creating a chrome extension, so I decided to practice it on studyblue.com. Studyblue.com is a great resource for getting quick answers, however their website blurs out the answer. 

# Solution
This can easily be fixed by manipulating the css to unblur the text and decrease font size and increase box size to display more information.
